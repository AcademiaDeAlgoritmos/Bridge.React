	/// whose individual properties are the same as the previous Props reference. Only a shallow equality check is performed, with simple referential equality tests performed - this
	/// will be most reliable if immutable, persistent types are used for any nested data structures (as is the case with the PureRenderMixin). Using this base class means that there
	/// is often less work for the Virtual DOM to do, meaning that UI updates require less work / are faster / are more efficient (it also means it is not possible to provide a custom
	/// ShouldComponentUpdate implementation, since there is already an internal one required to make this work). As with the Component and StatelessComponent base classes (and due to
	/// C# supporting multiple constructor signatures - unlike JavaScript), the constructors will not be executed and so any logic or member initialisation in there will be ignored.
